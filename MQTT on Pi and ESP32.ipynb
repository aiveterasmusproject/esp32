    "# Installing and Setting up Mosquitto on Raspberry Pi\n",
    "\n",
    "MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport https://mqtt.org) is a lightweight messaging protocol designed for small sensors and mobile devices, optimized for high-latency or unreliable networks. **Mosquitto** is a lightweight open-source message broker that implements the MQTT protocol. This guide will walk you through the installation and setup of Mosquitto on a Raspberry Pi and using the online broker HiveMQ (https://www.hivemq.com).\n",

    "## Installation Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Update and Upgrade Packages**\n",
    "\n",
    "Open a terminal in the Raspberry Pi and make sure your system is up to date by running:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",

    "sudo apt upgrade\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Install Mosquitto Broker and Client**s\n",
    "\n",
    "To install **Mosquitto** server and clients, enter the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "sudo apt install mosquitto mosquitto-clients\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Disable Mosquitto Service autostart (only if you don't want it to automatically start)** \n",
    "\n",
    "After the installation, the **Mosquitto** server should be active. You can check the status with:\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "sudo systemctl status mosquitto\n",
    "```\n",
    "You will get a information similar to this:\n",
